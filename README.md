# Codesignal
### Programming Exercies
I started using [Codesignal] (https://app.codesignal.com/) as a website to familiarize myself with Python. At this point in time Java was the only programming language that I dove into full force. I had been programming with Java for about four years now, and although I dabbled in languages such as JavaScript, Python, and C++ in the past, I never strayed too far from my first language. [Codesignal] (https://app.codesignal.com/) helped me in my self-learning of more programming languages.
